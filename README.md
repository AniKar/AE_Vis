# Autoencoder_mnist

The repository contains an autoencoder model implementation in *Keras*, which is trained on *MNIST* dataset of handwritten digits.

Animations have been created to demonstrate the interpolation property of the latent space.

Also, used PCA and LDA dimensionaluty reduction methods to transform the latent representation (32D) of images to 2D, and plotted the results.
